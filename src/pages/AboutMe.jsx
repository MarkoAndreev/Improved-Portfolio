      <p>Hello my name is Marko Andreev</p>

      <p>
        I am a very passionate and dedicated full-stack developer. I love going
        thorough and solving complicated problems.
      </p>

      <p>
        In my free time I love gaming, weather it's playing a challenging solo
        game or playing and competing with other people, gaming is a hobby that
        brings me joy.
      </p>

      <p>
        I'm excited about the endless possibilities in the world of software
        development and look forward to being part of a team that shares my love
        for the same subject.
      </p>
